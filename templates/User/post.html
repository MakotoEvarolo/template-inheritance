        <h1>My Journey with Python and My Excitement for React</h1>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Makoto Evarolo</p>
        <br>
        <p>Programming has always fascinated me, and Python is the language that made me fall in love with coding. Its simplicity, flexibility, and power make it an incredible tool 
            for everything from automating tasks to building web applications. I love how intuitive it feels, allowing me to focus more on problem solving rather than struggling with syntax. 
            Every time I write Python code, I appreciate how efficient and readable it is, and I’m always eager to explore new libraries and frameworks to expand my skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            While I feel comfortable with Python, React is something I’ve yet to dive into, but I’m incredibly excited to learn it. The idea of building interactive and dynamic web applications 
            using React sounds both challenging and rewarding. I know mastering React will open up new opportunities for me, and I can’t wait to write my first lines of code with it.
            
            My goal is to keep learning, experimenting, and improving. Whether it’s becoming more proficient in Python or finally getting hands-on with React, I’m excited for the journey ahead. 
            One day, I hope to master both and build amazing projects that I can truly be proud of.

        <h1>How Dota 2 and Valorant Made Gaming More Than Just a Hobby</h1>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Makoto Evarolo</p>
        <br>
        <p>Video games have always been a big part of my life, but Dota 2 and Valorant hold a special place in my heart. These games aren’t just about winning or ranking up they’ve 
            become a way for me to unwind, challenge myself, and connect with amazing people.

            Dota 2 taught me patience, strategy, and teamwork. The complexity of the game always keeps me engaged, and every match feels like a new puzzle to solve. Whether it’s 
            pulling off a game changing play or simply improving my skills, I love the sense of growth and competition it brings.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, Valorant is my go to for fast-paced action and intense gunfights. The mix of precise aim, agent abilities, and tactical plays makes every round exciting. 
            But what I appreciate most is how it brings people together. I’ve made so many friends through late-night ranked matches, casual games, and even just joking around in voice chat.

            These games are more than just entertainment they’ve given me unforgettable memories, taught me valuable lessons, and introduced me to people I wouldn’t have met otherwise. 
            That’s why I’ll always love and appreciate them.

        <h1>My Love for Soccer and Basketball</h1>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Makoto Evarolo</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a child, I was always fascinated by sports, especially soccer and basketball. I started playing soccer when I was in first grade, and although I didn't have the skills yet, 
            the experience was unforgettable. I remember spending hours watching Lionel Messi’s games on YouTube, mesmerized by his brilliance on the field during his time with Barcelona. 
            Messi wasn’t just a player to me he was an inspiration. His incredible talent, vision, and mastery of the game made him my favorite soccer player.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I entered high school, my passion for playing soccer began to fade, but my love for watching it remained strong. Around that time, basketball became my second sport. My friends 
            and I would go from one basketball court to another, playing against anyone willing to compete. The thrill of winning a game with my friends made basketball even more exciting. 
            There was something special about the teamwork, the competition, and the pure joy of the sport that made me appreciate it even more.
            
            Though my interests shifted over time, my love for sports has never wavered. Whether it’s soccer or basketball, watching or playing, the passion and excitement that sports bring 
            into my life will always be something I cherish.</p>
